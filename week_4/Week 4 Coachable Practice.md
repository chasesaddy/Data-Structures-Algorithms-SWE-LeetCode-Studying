## Match Sorting Algorithms

Here is an array that we're trying to sort several different ways. We'll provide the intermediate sorting stage, and you'll need to determine which sorting algorithm was used. We'll give you the first one as an example.

For some of them, multiple algorithms might apply. List as many as you can. 

#### Initial and Sorted Input
(initial) [3, 8, 2, 15, 27, 21, 17, 10, 16, 7, 24, 0, 4, 6, 18, 5]
(sorted)  [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 24, 27]

#### Intermediate Stages To Identify
a) [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 21, 17, 10, 16, 7, 24, 8, 27, 6, 18, 15]
b) [2, 0, 4, 6, 5, 3, 7, 15, 27, 21, 17, 10, 16, 8, 24, 18]
c) [0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 21, 24, 27, 4, 6, 18, 5]
d) [2, 3, 8, 15, 10, 17, 21, 27, 0, 7, 16, 24, 4, 5, 6, 18]

A. 
(a) is selection sort because the array  0,2,3,4, 5 contains the smallest elements of the array in order - they are in the final positions for the sorted array. The other elements are primarily untouched, except for those that had 0,2,3,4,5 in their original positions.
(b)
(c)
(d)
