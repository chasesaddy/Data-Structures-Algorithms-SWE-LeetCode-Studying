Suppose youâ€™re given a list of graph edges where each edge is of the form 
("e1", "e2", 3), meaning that "e1" is connected to "e2" and has an 
edge weight of 3. The graph is connected. Write an algorithm to print 
out the an MST of the graph.

You can assume the graph is undirected for this problem. 
If there is an edge (e1, e2, 3) in the input,
you should assume there is an equivalent edge (e2, e1, 3) as well.
